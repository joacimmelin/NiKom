# The DOMAIN entry configures which Fido compatible networks this BBS
# is connected to. Up to 10 domains can be configured. The syntax is
# DOMAIN <number> <name> <address> <zone> [<zones>...]
# number  - An id number for this domain that NiKom will use to reference
#           it. Once this domain has started to be used this number must
#           not change.
# namn    - A human readable name for this domain.
# address - Which address NiKom should use when creating texts in this
#           domain.
# zone    - One or more zones that this domain applies to. This is a
#           space delimitedlist of zone numbers followed by a colon.
#           E.g. "1: 2: 3:"

# Names that this BBS should accept as recipients for incoming mail
# even though there is no user with that name. The syntax is

# The Matrix directories where netmail is exported to and imported from.
# There can be a maximum of 10 matrix dirs configured. Each directory
# name can optionally be followed by one or more zones that indicate
# which receipient zones that should be used for this directory.
# When an outgoing netmail is written the list of directories is scanned
# from top to bottom and the first one with a matching zone will be
# picked. If no zones are configured the directory will match all zones.
# An entry like this should typically be the last in the list.
#
# E.g.
# MATRIXDIR = Mail:AmigaNet 39: 40:
# MATRXIDIR = Mail:FidoNet

MATRIXDIR = Mail:Matrix

# User groups that should be allowed to send netmail. There can be zero

# This option controls how NiKom reads 16 bit values from .msg files.
# FTS (FidoNet Technical Standard) mandates that 16 bit values are stored
# in little endian format (with the lowest order bits in the first byte),
# the way that x86 processors handle it. However it seems like tossers
# for AmigaOS usually violates this and store values in big endian format,
# the way 680x0 processors handle it. Set this to "BIG_ENDIAN" to be
# compatible with Amiga tossers and "LITTLE_ENDIAN" to be compatible with
# tossers that actually follow the standard. (Intentionally or not..)
